# Goldbach Giant

This project explores the decomposition of very large even numbers into sums of two prime numbers, in accordance with Goldbach's conjecture.

It is designed to handle extremely large values (up to 10^50 and beyond) using optimized algorithms and high-precision arithmetic.

Try it, test it, and push the limits of prime decomposition!
